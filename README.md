# STEP Resources
This is a collation of freely and publicly available resources for STEP Prep collated into a useful central repository. 

# Notes
The years that have official markschemes published have their markschemes included in the repository. I am working on adding various markschemes for years in which the markschemes were released via FoI requests or the like.
